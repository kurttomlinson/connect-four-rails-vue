    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>When it is a human's turn to play, click one of the buttons labeled "0" through "6" to pick a column for your move.</p>
    <p>The search depth determines how many moves into the future the computer should look before picking a move. Higher search depths make the computer a more difficult opponent.</p>
    <p>Click the "Reset" button at any time to clear the game board and start over.</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/kurttomlinson/connect-four-rails-vue">connect-four-rails-vue</a>, written by <a href="https://kurttomlinson.com">Kurt Tomlinson</a> is built using Ruby on Rails and Vue.js. The Ruby on Rails backend computes the moves made by computer players and determines if a given sequence of moves corresponds with an end-game state (tie game, player one wins, player two wins) or an on-going game.</p>
    <p>The Ruby on Rails backend leverages <a href="https://github.com/kurttomlinson/console-connect-four">console-connect-four</a>, also written by Kurt Tomlinson, to calculate computer moves and game results. The <strong>console-connect-four</strong> source code is included in the <strong>connect-four-rails-vue</strong> project as a git submodule.</p>
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>Although <strong>connect-four-rails-vue</strong> is in a working state, there are a few improvements I'd like to make in the future.</p>
    <p>First, I'd like to enable the ability to save and load games. This could be easily accomplished by creating a <strong>games</strong> table in the database with a string column named <strong>moves</strong>. I'd use <strong>serialize :moves, Array</strong> in the games model to enable easy storage and retrieval of the move sequence for each saved game.</p>
    <p>Second, while importing <strong>console-connect-four</strong> as a git submodule is a workable solution, I'd like to turn it into a gem that could be more easily imported into the Rails backend without cluttering up the lib folder.</p>
