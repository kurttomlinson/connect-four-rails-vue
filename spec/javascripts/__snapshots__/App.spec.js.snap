    Instructions
  </h2>
   
  <p>
    When it is a human's turn to play, click one of the buttons labeled "0" through "6" to pick a column for your move.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    The search depth determines how many moves into the future the computer should look before picking a move. Higher search depths make the computer a more difficult opponent.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Click the "Reset" button at any time to clear the game board and start over.

     is built using Ruby on Rails and Vue.js. The Ruby on Rails backend computes the moves made by computer players and determines if a given sequence of moves corresponds with an end-game state (tie game, player one wins, player two wins) or an on-going game.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    The Ruby on Rails backend leverages 
    <a
      href="https://github.com/kurttomlinson/console-connect-four"
    >
      console-connect-four
    </a>
    , also written by Kurt Tomlinson, to calculate computer moves and game results. The 
    <strong>
      console-connect-four
    </strong>
     source code is included in the 
    <strong>
      connect-four-rails-vue
    </strong>
     project as a git submodule.

  <h2>
    Future Work
  </h2>
   
  <p>
    Although 
    <strong>
      connect-four-rails-vue
    </strong>
     is in a working state, there are a few improvements I'd like to make in the future.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    First, I'd like to enable the ability to save and load games. This could be easily accomplished by creating a 
    <strong>
      games
    </strong>
     table in the database with a string column named 
    <strong>
      moves
    </strong>
    . I'd use 
    <strong>
      serialize :moves, Array
    </strong>
     in the games model to enable easy storage and retrieval of the move sequence for each saved game.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Second, while importing 
    <strong>
      console-connect-four
    </strong>
     as a git submodule is a workable solution, I'd like to turn it into a gem that could be more easily imported into the Rails backend without cluttering up the lib folder.
  </p>
